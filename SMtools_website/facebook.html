    <h2>Uses for Teaching and Learning</h2>
    <p>Facebook has many useful features, some of which can be used for teaching and learniing purposes.

Members of this group can then or each other to see. So for a class, the lecturer could post pdf douments with lectures or assignments. Students could also post any questions they may have.</p>
